## OsmAnd Submodules

Repository holding [OsmAnd](https://github.com/osmandapp) releases set up with sane submodules and tags.

Includes a small script you can use to build your own full-featured releases easily.

## Updating

Update submodules to use commits specified in the [last stable build of OsmAnd](http://builder.osmand.net:8080/view/OsmAnd%20Builds/job/Osmand-release/lastStableBuild/tagBuild/) and adapt `build` accordingly.

## Notes
* Still downloads binaries from upstreams buildserver.
